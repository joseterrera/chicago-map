### A Chicago map 

This is a project using knockout.js and google and flickr apis.
You can view this project [here](http://joseterrera.github.io/chicago-map/).

There is a search bar that filters results and the markers. Also, each window in the map will have a button that will open a flickr picture related to the area.
