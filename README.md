This is an interactive using knockout.js and google and flickr apis.
You can view this project [here](http://joseterrera.github.io/chicago-map/).

To run this project, you may clone it and open index.html. 

There is a search bar that filters results and the markers. Also, each window in the map will have a button that will open a flickr picture related to the area.
